# SEDATED&#8480;
The **SEDATED&#8480;** Project (Sensitive Enterprise Data Analyzer To Eliminate Disclosure) focuses on preventing sensitive data such as user credentials and tokens from being pushed to Git. 

With the myriad of code changes required in today's CICD environment developers are constantly pushing code that could unintentionally contain sensitive information. This potential sensitive data exposure represents a huge risk to organizations ([2017 OWASP Top Ten #3 - Sensitive Data Exposure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)). **SEDATED&#8480;** addresses this issue by automatically reviewing all incoming code changes and providing instant feedback to the developer. If it identifies sensitive data it will prevent the commit(s) from being pushed to the Git server.
